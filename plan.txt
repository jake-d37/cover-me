## PLAN FOR COVERME ##

Tech stack:
- React
- TypeScript
- DeepSeek, for generating cover letter content
- jsPDF, for exporting cover letter as a PDF
- pdf.js, for uploading resume as PDF to be parsed
- mammoth, for uploading resume as docx to be parsed
- Vercel functions, serverless functions used for scraping job descriptions
- (later) Firebase Storage, for saving resumes
- (later) Firebase, for user authentication 

Process:
- User fills in fields like name, email, etc.
- User selects from their previous resumes or uploads a new resume (PDF)
    - previous resumes will begin as stored locally in indexdb, but later in firebase
- User pastes the link of the job description page, or pastes description directly into text area
    - if link has linkedin domain (or other domain you can't scrape) reject and show warning
    - the text parsed returned from scraping will show in the text area
- User selects tone of message from pills of options
- user puts any final requests in natural language in a text input
- User presses "generate cover letter"
    - this will concatinate (1) the system prompt, (2) the parsed text of the selected resume and user info fields,
        (3) the parsed text of the job description, (3) another system prompt with chosen tone identifiers,
        (5) final requests written by the user
    - the concatinated text will be given to DeepSeek, and the text returned will be set as the value for the text area
- User can edit the text generated by DeepSeek, and it will be suggested that they take out em dashes
- User can export their cover letter as a PDF (using jsPDF)

Form fields needed:
- text input, name
- text input, email
- text input, phone number (optional)
- (optional, multiple text inputs) link name + link url

- select or upload resume (array, max 5)

- text input, link to job description
- text area, job description

- pills, preferred tone

- text input, final requests (eg. please highlight my experience at...)

- submit button, generate cover letter text

- text area, cover letter output

- submit button, export cover letter as PDF
